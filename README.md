# Pagination-with-JavaScript

To add a dropdown menu to select the number of items and a search bar using JavaScript to the existing pagination implementation, we would need to modify the JavaScript code to include these features.

For the dropdown menu, we would need to create an HTML select element and populate it with options for the user to choose from. Then, we would need to update the JavaScript code to listen for changes to the selected option and update the number of rows displayed per page accordingly.

For the search bar, we would need to create an HTML input element and attach an event listener to it to capture user input. Then, we would need to update the JavaScript code to filter the table rows based on the search query and update the table and pagination buttons accordingly.

Overall, these features can enhance the usability of the table by allowing users to customize the number of items displayed per page and quickly search for specific data. By using JavaScript to implement these features, we can create a more interactive and user-friendly experience for our web application.
